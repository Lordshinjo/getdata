# How to use
1. First, download the dataset from this [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Then extract the zip somewhere.
3. Run R, and make the location of the extracted files your working directory.
4. Source `run_analysis.R`.
5. The `RunAnalysis()` function will extract the relevant data from the dataset, and make it tidy.

See the [code book](CodeBook.md) for information about the variables.
